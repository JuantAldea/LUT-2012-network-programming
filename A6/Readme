Description
	- Implemented a ftp client with basic operations
		- open: connect to the server and do the authentication process.
		- ls: list files in the current working directory.
		- cd: change working directory.
		- get: download file.
		- put: upload file to the working directory.
		- close: disconnect from the server
		- quit: disconnect and close the client.
		- active: set the client to active mode
		- passive: set the client to passive mode.
		- help: issues the help command
		- syst: issues the syst command
		- status: issues the stat command.
		- raw: allows the user to send any command to the server (for example "raw USR someone")
	- Binary command not implemented since is the only mode available, the mode is set by default as soon as the authentication process is finished.

Optional and added features:
	- syst command
	- help command
	- status command
	- active mode
	- authentication process
	- transfer rate in Kilobytes/second
	- raw command mode
