Description
	- UDP client and server that exchange aphorisms between them

File description
	.
	├── client.c Client main function, also function related to message presentation
	├── common.c Only a function, fflush_stdin
	├── common.h
	├── linked_list.c client_t type related functions
	├── linked_list.h
	├── Makefile Build instructions
	├── protocol.c Functions for receive and send messages according to the protocol rules
	├── protocol.h
	├── Readme This file, infinite recursion
	├── server.c Server main function, server CLI and functions for dealing with the messages
	├── server.h
	├── server_commands.h Constants definition file for the server CLI
	└── system_headers.h Just a bunch of system includes

Implemented features
	- Parameters managed by getopt
	- Unlimited number aphorisms
		- Managed with a double linked list
	-Aphorisms are added to the database in real time
		- Client blocks on recvfrom only for 5 seconds
	- CLI
		- list: list the full list of aphorisms
		- quit: exit
Building
	- make || make all || make build
	- clean target also included

Execution
	- Client: ./aphorismclient -h <server address> -p <port number> -c <command>
	- Server: ./aphorismserver -p <listening port>

Questions:
	- How to detect when connection is lost / application has crashed at the other end with UDP?
		Since UDP is a connectionless protocol it makes no sense talk about conections. You can't detect disconnects
    - What is the maximum size for UDP datagram in class 6325?
    	C & P from wikipedia:

		A field that specifies the length in bytes of the entire datagram: header and data. The minimum length is 8 bytes since that's the length of the header. The field size sets a theoretical limit of 65,535 bytes (8 byte header + 65,527 bytes of data) for a UDP datagram.
		 *******The practical limit for the data length which is imposed by the underlying IPv4 protocol is 65,507 bytes (65,535 − 8 byte UDP header − 20 byte IP header).***********

		In IPv6 Jumbograms it is possible to have UDP packets of size greater than 65,535 bytes.
		*********This allows for a maximum length value of 4,294,967,295 bytes (2^32 - 1) with 8 bytes representing the header and 4,294,967,287 bytes for data.).***********
