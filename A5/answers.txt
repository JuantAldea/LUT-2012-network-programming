- What are the differences between SCTP one-to-one and one-to-many styles? Why there are 2 “different” styles?
    - A one to one connection is like the classical TCP connection but working with SCTP associations, this allows to port TCP applications to SCTP very easily.
    - One to many is like UDP in a sense that you can handle multiple connections (SCTP associations) with only one socket.
    - I don't know what to answer to the "why?" question, since I've already said the parallelism between TCP and one-to-one and UDP and one-to-many.

- Why SCTP can be regarded as more secure as TCP?
    Because it uses a 4-way handshaking that protects the system against the SYN flood DoS attack.
    - The problem with TCP is that the server is the first to commit resources during the connection establishment.
    - In SCTP the client needs to commit resources first so flooding a server will also flood the attacker system.

- Explain the difference between a connection (TCP) and an association (SCTP).
    - In TCP a connection is unique, you can have multiple connections between endpoints but you have to handle them as different connections, is a one-to-one connection.
    - In SCTP an association could consists in a one-to-many connection between the same host and server, it also supports multiple streams within the same connection.

- What benefits does the multi-homing feature of SCTP give? Give at least 3 examples.
    - More robust connection: If a connection fails other connection of the same association could be used without any intervention.
    - Examples:
       - Roaming between ethernet and WiFi connections.
       - Link Redundancy for critical systems, like banking systems.
       - Transparent roaming between the cells of a mobile network.

- Explain Head-of-line blocking. Why it is a problem with TCP? How SCTP handles this or how this affects SCTP? Give an example application/application layer protocol that could benefit from SCTP where head-of-line blocking can occur.
    - Head-of-line blocking happens when the connection is waiting for the retransmission of a packet.
    - In single stream connections, like TCP, the retransmission blocks the entire connection because the packets have to be received in the correct order.
    - In SCTP, as it is multi-stream, only one stream gets block waiting for the retransmission.
    - Any kind of application that could benefit from a parallel transmission, for example a videoconference protocol could use one stream for voice and other for video.
