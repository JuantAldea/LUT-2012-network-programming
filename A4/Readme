Description
    - UDP multicast tic-tac-toe game
    - The problem is solved using three separated sockets
        - Multicast socket
        - Server socket -> Used when the other player "calls" to the server
        - Client socket -> Used for calling to other players.

Implemented features
    - Parameters managed by getopt
    - Players saved to a double linked list
        - The list doesn't contains duplicates.
        - Players that report error are removed from the list
    - CLI
        - quit: You can quit from a game and from the application, if you are playing /quit will make you leave your current game but not quit from the application.
Building
    - make || make all || make build
    - clean target also included

Execution
    - ./gameclient -m <multicast address> -p <port> -o <open port>
