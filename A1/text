The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the core protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite
TCP is one of the two original components of the suite, complementing the Internet Protocol (IP), and therefore the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP.
TCP provides reliable, ordered delivery of a stream of octets from a program on one computer to another program on another computer.
TCP is the protocol used by major Internet applications such as the World Wide Web, email, remote administration and file transfer.
Other applications, which do not require reliable data stream service, may use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which provides a datagram service that emphasizes reduced latency over reliability.
In May 1974 the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) published a paper entitled "A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication."[1] The paper's authors, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, described an internetworking protocol for sharing resources using packet-switching among the nodes.
A central control component of this model was the Transmission Control Program that incorporated both connection-oriented links and datagram services between hosts.
The monolithic Transmission Control Program was later divided into a modular architecture consisting of the Transmission Control Protocol at the connection-oriented layer and the Internet Protocol at the internetworking (datagram) layer.
The model became known informally as TCP/IP, although formally it was henceforth called the Internet Protocol Suite.
